We identify and collaborate upon underdeveloped articles that require improvement. Our goal is to use widespread collaborative editing to improve articles over a short time frame. So far, we have improved hundreds of articles; some have even been promoted to good or featured article status! Boldly edit the current article for improvement, or join the project today!
This week's article for improvement is:
Island
Previous selections:
Textbook ·
Centrism ·
Waffle iron
Greenland is the world's largest island.The project's four main tasks are to:
 Did you know? article for 15 January 2016
 Did you know? article for 9 February 2016
– See the Accomplishments page for additional articles.
The project member list is located at the Members page.
Our assessment criteria and procedure are explained on the Assessment page. Like many other WikiProjects, AFI assesses the articles it is involved with. Unlike other projects, we only assess the article's state before and immediately after its week of collaborative editing – that improvement is one (but not the only) measure of our success.
AFI makes use of various templates. See the Automation page for details, including banners, talk page messages, user and project maintenance templates. The project's bot tasks are also listed here, currently undertaken by MusikBot.

The Articles for Improvement archives are split over several pages:
The accomplishments page also includes a record of selections since 2013 alongside other information. Some archives of a predecessor version of this project that existed c. 2012 are located as subpages. This project was previously known as "Today's article for improvement" (TAFI), and there may be a few remnants of the renaming in places.
See the Project management page for information.
